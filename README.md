# Python Wordle Game Assignment

This Python project is a simple implementation of a Wordle-like game created for educational purposes. The game is designed to run with a graphical user interface (GUI) using Tkinter, and it incorporates basic game logic and interaction handling through keyboard inputs.

## Setup and Running the Game

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x installed on your system.
- Tkinter installed (comes with Python for most distributions).
- `pynput` library for capturing keyboard events. Install via pip if necessary:
pip install pynput

### Installation

1. Clone this repository or download the game files to your local machine.

2. Ensure you have the required text file `englishWords.txt` in the same directory as your game script. This file should contain a list of valid English words, one per line.

### How to Run

Navigate to the directory containing the game's script and run:
python main.py

## Game Objective

This game is inspired by Wordle (New York Times). The goal of the game is to guess a secret word by typing letters and submitting guesses. The game provides feedback for each guess in the form of colored tiles, indicating how close your guess is to the word.

## Assignment Task

Students are expected to complete certain parts of the logic to have a fully functional game. Specifically, areas related to word validation, guess feedback (color coding), and game win/loss logic require implementation.

## Contributing

This project is intended as a starting point for students to practice programming concepts in Python. Contributions to expand the game or enhance its functionality are welcome.
